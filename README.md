# hello-world
Just another repository, but my first!

I am updating my readme file so I can learn how to create and edit readme files. Unlike Hubot, I have never 
had tacos on the moon and thus (with no othe planetary travel yet) I find Earth tacos far superior. 
I have no other experience to compare Earth tacos to other planet or moon tacos.

I do have experience in C++, Java and .NET. I prefer Java and .NET.
